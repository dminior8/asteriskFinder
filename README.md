### Testing

The project includes unit tests for the `JsonService` class. These tests ensure the correctness of JSON validation and asterisk detection functionalities.

To run the tests:

1. Navigate to the `JsonServiceTest` class located in `src/test/java/pl.dminior8.asteriskfinder`.
2. Run the tests using your IDE's testing facilities or via Maven command line. Navigate to the root directory of your Maven project (where the `pom.xml` file is located) and run the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```
This command will compile your project's source code, execute all unit tests in the `src/test/java` directory, and provide a summary of the test results.

### Dependencies

- JavaFX: Provides the framework for building the graphical user interface.
- BootstrapFX: Used for styling the JavaFX application.
- JUnit: Testing framework for unit tests.
- Mockito: Testing framework for mock tests.
